# Prenatal somatic mosaic mutations at active transcription factor binding sites are associated with schizophrenia

This github repository contains the code to generate the main figures and analyes associated with the manuscript by Jones & Maury et al. 

**Note** Note that since the manuscript depends on genetic data. The somatic calls and subject level data cannot be made available through a public github repository. However, the data will be made available in the manuscript through the NIMH Data Archive (collection C2965).

## Directory layout

The `notebooks` folder contains the main scripts to reproduce the main figures and associated analyes.  

Each notebook contains a call to `sessionInfo()`, which describes all the dependencies and parameters used in the notebook.
